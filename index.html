 				Although I have learned a lot about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade. Just a player who loves to spend time in Sosaria. I started around the Age of shadows.
	That said I have added many new pets and items. Take for instance  our new Miners Dragon. Exclusively designed for miners.  
Like the fire Beetle, the miners Dragon can smelt your ore. Then hold the ingots in there Backpack. At a Max  hold weights of 2,000 stones you can stay out all day and not tire them out. 
By chance if you find yourself mining in Deciet or covetous, no worries. They are very loyal and as strong as there cousins, the greater dragon.
During there testing stages they performed very well at protecting there Miners, from the cowherd's (PK'rs) who sometime pray on unsuspecting miners.
OH!! Did I mention? you can ride them home at the end, of a long day of mining...
